    "2. Building Decision Trees: For each of these bootstrap samples, a decision tree is built. When building the decision trees, at each node, a random subset of features are considered for splitting. This introduces further randomness into the model.\n",

    "3. Prediction: For a classification problem, the output class is the mode of the classes output by individual trees. For a regression problem, the final prediction is the average prediction of the individual trees."
